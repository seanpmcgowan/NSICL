<h3>#75 Jim Edmonds</h3>

<p>Another great shot of another great center fielder.  His uniform number (25)
almost matches another similar great catch <a href="Cards/1959M.JPG">(Mays #24)</a>
In the 1998 set there were golf clubs, footballs, ace bandages, and collections of stolen
bases, but my favorite cards, the "coolest" ones, are cards like this.
The next in the commemerative series was <a href="Cards/1998C.JPG">#21 Roberto Clemente</a> 
25 years after his death.  On <a href="Cards/1998A.JPG">card #146, Jose Guillen</a> also
shows a little admiration for the fallen star.</p>
