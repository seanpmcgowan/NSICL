<p>There were only 2 cards that really jumped (get it?) out at me.  The Uribe and
<a href="Cards/2006A.JPG">#391 Casey Blake</a>.  Check out the shadow of the ball.
A couple of honorable mentions were <a href="Cards/2006C.JPG">#207 Billy Wagner</a>
which reminded me of the <a href="Cards/1974.JPG">1974 Ryan</a>.
And <a href="Cards/2006D.JPG">#115 Adam Dunn</a>
which just reminded me of catching fly balls.  Although there weren't many creative
or exciting shots in this set, there were four or five shots of bunt attempts and 
<a href="Cards/2006B.JPG">#376 Luis Gonzalez</a> was my favorite, for two reasons.
1 - it is a nice looking bunt attempt, and 2 - how often do you get a 38-year-old guy
with 316 career homeruns to lay one down?
Topps decided to sort of "un-retire" card #7 by making a
<a href="Cards/2006MM2.JPG">2006 Mickey Mantle</a>.  Toops also had an insert set 
with Mantle cards in the style of each year 1997-2005 presumably to cover all the
empty #7 spots in all those binders.  My favorite one is the
<a href="Cards/2006MM1.JPG">1997-style Mantle</a>.  To continue on the Mantle theme...
In the first series, every 6th pack or so had a 1955-ish Mantle commemerating his
first HR.  In the 2nd series they had the same card for HRs #2-#100.  All the same
front, except for the number, and same back, except for the description of the
particular HR.  I give you the <a href="Cards/2006MM3.JPG">front of #1 and the back of #9</a>.
