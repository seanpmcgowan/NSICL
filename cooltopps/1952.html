<p>The '52's are not much more creative than the '51's.  Mostly head shots with a few
"action" poses, <a href="Cards/1952A.JPG">#121 Gus Niarhos and #265 Chuck Diering are good examples</a>.  But, this choice was a no-brainer!
When you read the back, you will see that gus smacked 6 home runs in 3 games, and 7
in 4 games.  It also mentions that he was a radio mechanic in the Navy during World
War II.  And when you look at his birthdate (june 1923) you realize that he was only
22 when the war ended!  I think today's players (and owners) should have to read the
backs of all the '52 Topps cards.  Gus is not anywhere near alone as a wartime veteran.</p>
