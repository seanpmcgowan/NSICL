<p>This set looks alot like the '55's, except the background pictures are
very exciting in '56.  Lots of jumping players, stretching first basemen,
and tons of plays at the plate.  Some of these are pretty funny, because it
is difficult to figure out exactly what is going on and who is who, but overall,
nifty stuff.  Rocky here takes the cake though!  Not any real clue about where
he is going, but he will be there fast and hard!  Did I mention that his name
is Everett Lamar Bridges?
