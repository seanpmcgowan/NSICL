<p>I think the cards in this set were just too dark.  Maybe that is why I like
this one of "Donnie Baseball" so much.  I really had a tough time deciding between
this one and <a href="Cards/1986A.JPG">#218 Randy Hunt and #85 Perez</a>.  I like 
the whole cap thing that Mr. Hunt has going on there.  I think
the fact that this one is Mattingly swayed me a little.  I always liked the way he
played the game.  In '86 Topps honored Pete Rose with the first 7 cards of the set
containing little pictures of all his previous cards (except #1 which was the '86
Rose).  I like <a href="Cards/1986R.JPG">#2 1963-1966</a> the best, of course!
