<p> In 1978 I only bought about 5 packs of cards.  So, 10+ years later when I started to
try to complete all my topps sets, I was thrilled to discover that this was one of the cards
I pulled in those 5 packs!  I always liked this picture because it just looks like Eddie is
thinking... "I'm going to hit 500 home runs and be a pain in the media's collective butt while
I do it!".  Another favorite of mine, the <a href="Cards/1978R.JPG">#200 Reggie</a>, is also
a classic.  That is just the pose you think of when you think of Reggie.
