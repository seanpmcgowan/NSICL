<h1>1966 Topps</h1>
<h3>#7 Tracy Stallard</h3>
</center>This is one of my favorite sets.  It includes a bunch of nifty looking
cards of many of my favorite players... <a href="Cards/1966A.JPG">#1-Mays,#50-Mantle,#70-Yaz,#126-Palmer,
#365-Maris and #410-Kaline</a>.  But my favorite is one of the first '66's I ever owned.
I noticed early on, reading the back of the card, of course, that Tracy and I shared
a birthday (August 31st) and that endeared him to me.  It wasn't until years later
That I discoverd that it was Mr. Stallard who delivered #61 to Maris in '61.  That 
just made him all the more special!
