<p>Although they are a very nice design, the '68s don't do much for me.  I do
love this card of "the blade".  If you never saw this guy in action, then you
don't know what "range" is!  A couple close contenders were RedSox <a href="Cards/1968A.JPG">#140-Tony C.
and #250-Yaz</a>.  The World Series card for the 1967 series were cool.  My favorite
one is <a href="Cards/1968WS.JPG">#152 game 2</a>, staring Yaz.  There is also a great insert set in 1968
that I use to play simulated games with my son.  I don't know how much research they did to try
to make the resluts work out reasonable, but they usually do.  Try it if you get a chance.  My
favorite card from the 33 card set is the <a href="Cards/1968G.JPG">#8 Home Run card</a>, of the "Say Hey" kid, of course!
