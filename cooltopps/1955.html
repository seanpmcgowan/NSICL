<p>The 1955 set is not ugly, but it is pretty redundant.  Harry's pose is
about the best they could come up with, but what put this card on my
list is the fact that we (baseball and the Red Sox) lost Harry so young.
He was the perfect home-town (Lynn Ma.) hero for Boston.  He would have
been a veteran player on the '67 team.  Wow.
