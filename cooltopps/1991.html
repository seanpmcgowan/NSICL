<p>The 1991 set has a ton of good game photos.  This one is my favorite.  Walt is about
a mile from the bag!  The funny thing I noticed going through this set is that the editors
didn't seem to care how silly they made the players look... check out <a href="Cards/1991G.JPG">#657-Kingery,
#472-Manwaring, #165 Sandy Alomar, #496 Barrett, #437 Dascenzo, #672 Shane Mack, and #614 Salazar</a>.  But, the
sillyest looking ones are without a doubt <a href="Cards/1991A.JPG">#667 Kent Anderson and #148
Rey Palacios</a>.  Finally we have proof that there is a fine line between a cool pose and a
head case.  You decide about <a href="Cards/1991HC.JPG">#450 Boggs and #530 Clemens</a>.
