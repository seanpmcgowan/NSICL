<p>The 1974 set was the first set released as one single series.  There were 
many "action" cards, but far and away the best one is this Ryan.  It is scary
just looking at it! The <a href="Cards/1974A.JPG">#1 Aaron</a> card is kind of special.  The funny thing is
that these cards must have been printed before Aaron actually broke the record.
There were insert "traded" cards that all looked about the same as <a href="Cards/1974T.JPG">#59T Grimsley</a>.
They came in packs all year (I think) so they are not scarce.  The most interesting
thing about the '74 set is the "Wasington Nat'L Lea." variations.  During the winter
it looked like the San Diego Padres were going to move to Washington, but it never
happend.  The result is that Topps had some of the Padres already printed with the
"Wasington" variation.  Check the <a href="Cards/1974WNL.JPG">Team card #226 and #241 Beckert</a>.  Finally, we have the 
<a href="Cards/1974D.JPG">#582 Bucky Dent</a> card.  We will come back to this one.
