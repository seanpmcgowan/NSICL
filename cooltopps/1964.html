<h3>#200 Sandy Koufax</h3>
</center>
<p>I started buying baseball cards in 1969.  Somewhere I picked up a handfull
of '64's and Sandy was one of them.  As a kid in 1969, I knew that Koufax was
a great pitcher.  It would be a few years before I realized how great and
tragic his career was.  Since I never had the chance to open a pack and find
a card of Koufax, this one became special.</p>
<p>I love the World Series subsets that are 1 card/game, and any card
that says what <a href="Cards/1964A.JPG">#139 '63 WS game 4</a> says, must be included here!
Frank Howard got the only two Dodger hits, but Koufax allowed just a Mantle Home Run and scattered
five other hits, and
the Dodgers swept the Yankees.  That was fun just typing that!
