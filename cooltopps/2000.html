<p>Even though he is a Yankee, this is a nifty third-base type shot.  I even picked
it over one of my own Birds, <a href="Cards/2000B.JPG">#103 Brady Anderson</a> getting
into and under a pitch.  Nice cut and nice trajectory on the ball.  Why are all the nice
swings lefty?  This season <a href="Cards/2000A.JPG">Hank Aaron (#44)</a> was the commemerative
card.  I think for no other reason than Topps include as inserts in 2000, reprints of all
Aarons cards.
