<p>The 1960 set is so boring, it is a wonder that anyone even bought any
'61's!  My guess is that the cool All-Star cards at the end may have saved
them, along with the whole Maris/Mantle Home run chase in '61.  So, it is 
really pretty funny that I had to decide between <a href="Cards/1960MM.JPG">#377 Maris, #350 Mantle</a>
and Musial.  My daughter helped me pick.  She said Musial "looks like a 
good player".  I was leaning that way anyway.  Just as a side note... Check
out <a href="Cards/1960C.JPG">#398 Cuellar</a> where the small photo with the colored background appears
to be exactly the same as the large photo.  Also, remember "Marvelous Marv"
from the '58 set?  Well, on his <a href="Cards/1960T.JPG">'60 card #436</a>, the small picture seems to be the
exact same shot as the one on the '58 card.  Everything matches perfectly,
except the letters on the shirt are gone...Marv was traded to the A's in 
December of '59.
