<p>The '67 design is very similar to the '57 design.  Just bigger, more
colorful letters.  This is perhaps my 2nd favorite set.  Again, filled
with nice poses of players I like: <a href="Cards/1967A.JPG">#5-Ford,#30-Kaline,
#100-Frank Robinson,#250-Aaron,#319-Paul Blair and #528-Rico Petrocelli.</a>
There are also a couple of cards special to my heart...<a href="Cards/1967C.JPG">#1 of
Orioles Manager Bauer and his meal tickets Brooks and Frank</a>, and <a href="Cards/1967WS.JPG">#154 - World
Series game 4 card</a>, depicting Brooks about 3 feet in the air running and
jumping towards Dave McNally, who just finished off a complete game shutout
of the Dodgers to complete the 4 game sweep!  Great picture!  And by now you
may have a clue as to why the card shown is my favorite for this set. :)
