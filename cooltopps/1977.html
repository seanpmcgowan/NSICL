<p> 1977 was the year I graduated from high school.  It was the last year unitl about 1987 that I spent
any time at all with baseball cards.  Maybe that is why I like this set so much.  My favorite card was an
easy pick.  This picture of Fisk is almost as cool as the '71 Munson.  There are a few others I like that 
I didn't want to leave out, such as <a href="Cards/1977A.JPG">#600-Palmer, #150-Seaver, and #320-Ken Griffey</a>.
The cards of players who started (I think) the All Star game got a slightly different looking card.  Different
enough that I wanted to show the separately, so as not to confuse anyone.  I always liked the <a href="Cards/1977AS.JPG">#580-Brett, and the
#120-Carew</a> cards.  The biggest question that this set raises is:  Why was <a href="Cards/1977P.JPG">Jim Spencer (#648)</a> forced to play
in his pajamas?
