<p>With the exception of <a href="Cards/1954O.JPG">#139 O'Brien Twins</a>, this set is pretty much
all head shots, so again we have to rely on the art work and coloring alot.
This card has it all.  Ted with a great smile, and holding a bat...A bright
orange background :) ... and a nifty picture of that sweet lefty cut.
Don't forget to read about Ted's Fighter pilot career in Korea either.  The
fact that this is Ted Williams didn't hurt it's chances of being selected
as my favorite card in the set.
