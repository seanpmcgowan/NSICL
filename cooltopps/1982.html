<p>This time I had my son pick between this one and <a href="Cards/1982L.JPG">#91 Carney Lansford</a>.
He liked this one because he could see the pitchers hand and try to tell what he was throwing.  Do you
think many batters tried that?  In the '82 set topps had some "in Action" cards, simmilar to what they
did in 1972.  This time, however, the distinction between an "in action" card and a regular card got
a little blury.  Check out <a href="Cards/1982A.JPG">#305 and #306 of Don Sutton</a>.  And why do you
 suppose <a href="Cards/1982S.JPG">Champ Summers (#369)</a> has to take BP in the shower?
