Kent appears to be doing a good job tracking down this pop-up.  For style points, he has
already lost his cap.  There were several cool shots in the 1987 set.  I like this set, and
I remember it well because it was the year I started buying packs again.  <a href="Cards/1987A.JPG">#520 Clark and #653 Mitchell</a>
were two that made my finals for cool cards. Now, about drugs.  Take a look at these two slim
guys...<a href="Cards/1987S.JPG">#320 Bonds and #366 McGwire</a> are listed at 185 pounds and
215 pounds, respectively.  You make the call.  On a lighter note, remember the cool '72 of
Clemente?  Well, topps thought it was pretty cool too and remembered it with <a href="Cards/1987TBC.JPG">
#313 Turn Back The Clock</a>.
