<p>When I was looking at this card, I was thinking, wouldn't it be great to have
a shot like this of Ruth, or Mathewson, or Young pitching? One of my collecting 
buddies pointed out that <a href="Cards/2001CC.JPG">Chad Curtis (#540)</a> should be
the winner for this set, but this is my show :) There is also <a href="Cards/2001A.JPG">Gerald Williams (#52)</a>
doing his best Sadaharu Oh.  The 2001 set had a realy nifty subset called "Golden Moments".  The first reason it
was nifty is that it was a "subset", that is, part of the numbered set, not an "insert" set that would be a pain to 
complete.  Here are the coolest ones:
<ul>
<li><a href="Cards/2001MZ.JPG">#380 Bill Mazeroski</a> rounding third after winning the '60 series</li>
<li><a href="Cards/2001R.JPG">#381 Reggie Jackson</a> after his third HR in game 5 in 1977</li>
<li><a href="Cards/2001G.JPG">#382 Kirk Gibson</a> after putting the dodgers ahead in the 9th with a 2-run HR of Eckersley</a>
<li><a href="Cards/2001RM.JPG">#383 Roger Maris </a> hitting one of his 61 in '61</li> 
<li><a href="Cards/2001JC.JPG">#386 Joe Carter </a> hitting the walk-off winner in the 1993 series.  I love this picture, because 
I called this home run.  I could tell that Carter was sitting on the slider, because Mitch Williams couldn't throw a strike with
anything else.  Of course, I had no witnesses :(</li>
<li>And my personal favorite <a href="Cards/2001CF.JPG">#791 Carlton Fisk</a> winning game 6 of the 1975 series.  I was up very late
watching that game with my dad and my brother.  Cool stuff</li>
