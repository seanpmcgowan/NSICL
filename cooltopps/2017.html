<p>This is just a great baseball picture.  The look, the helmet, the stride, the eye black.  You can see the right fielder
charging the ball and getting ready to throw to the plate.  Just as it was last year, there are tons of great pictures
to choose from, but none that are head-and-shoulders above.  There were other iconic sort of pictures that I considered:</p>
<p>More baserunning from <a href="Cards/2017/cool17-01.jpg">Ichiro #699 and Travis Jankowski #124</a>.<br />
Two plays at the plate with <a href="Cards/2017/cool17-02.jpg">Jonathan Lucroy #346 and Kevin Pillar #6</a>.<br />
<a href="Cards/2017/cool17-03.jpg">Adam Jones #495, James McCann #418, and Aaron Altherr #66</a> gave us the standard spectacular
fielding shots.<br />
More iconic baseball poses from two Dodgers <a href="Cards/2017/cool17-04.jpg">Yasiel Puig #375 and Clayton Kershaw #50</a> <br />
<a href="Cards/2017/cool17-05.jpg">Mark Trumbo #616</a> is a cool center-field camera batting shot </p>
<p> I noticed a "throwback twin" with my 2003 coolest card of Ichiro, so I put the <a href="Cards/2017/cool17-06.jpg">2003 and 2017 Ichiros</a> together.<br />
And the Kershaw reminded me of another Dodger pitcher, so I found this <a href="Cards/2017/cool17-07.jpg">digital topps card that I give you here with the Kershaw.</a>
And, for the third consecutive year, without really trying, I give you an excellent physical specimen of a baseball player... 6-foot, 
6-inch and 300 lb <a href="Cards/2017/cool17-08.jpg">CC Sabathia #465</a></p>
