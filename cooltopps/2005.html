<p>Again in 2005 great action shots abound, but as soon as I saw this card, the game was up.
Any vintage card collector will instantly be reminded of <a href="Cards/2005C.JPG">Pee Wee 
Reese's 1953 Bowman</a> Color card.  There were 2 "close 2nds" in <a href="Cards/2005A.JPG">
#196 Terrence Long and #451 Jorge Posada</a>. The funny thing I noticed in this set was the
large number of balls about to be caught.  Take a look at these <a href="Cards/2005B.JPG">
9 catches</a> that are about to be made.  But without a doubt, the most special cards feature
the 2005 Red Sox winning the World Series!  Oddly, at the end of the first series there were
cards depicting <a href="Cards/2005WS1.JPG">game 1 and game 4</a> (the game 4 card isn't even
on a checklist!).  But the mystery was solved in series 2, and Topps finally has come back to the 
"1-game/1-card" plan that we all loved in the '60s and '70s. Boston fans, please enjoy the
<a href="Cards/2005WS2.JPG">2005 Red Sox World Series Sweep</a>.</p>
