<p>Perhaps the '57's didn't get good reviews, because topps went back to mostly
head shots and colered backgrounds in 1958.  There are 2 that stick out... <a href="Cards/1958C.JPG">#343
Cepeda</a> and this one of "Marvelous Marv".  Any working stiff from the '70s knows
Marv as the star of one of the first ever "Miller Lite" commercials.  That was
great stuff! :)  Marv did hit 40 homers in 560 at-bats in '57, and the card
promisses that he will be "cutting down on his whiffs".  Unfortunately that didn't
happen.
