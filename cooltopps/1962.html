<p>There are a couple neat-o "multi-bat-on-the-shoulder" cards, <a href="Cards/1962A.JPG">#93 John
Blanchard and #425 Yaz</a>.  But, when I was maybe 14, around 1973 or so, I had
a friend who must have inhereted his dad's cards.  He had tons of nice cards
from the early '60's and he gave me this Torre card.  Nice pose, backwards hat,
and trophy.  I think the only reason I still like Torre (even though he manages
the Yankees) is because of this card.
