<p> There really was no doubt from the time I pulled this out of the pack.  Game 2 of the World Series, really great catch,
the standings in the background...the only thing wrong with this card is that the ball is cropped out.  In spite of this "slam dunk",
there really were some great shots...#322 Brian McCann, #529 Chance Sisco, and #389 Victor Caratini give us <a href="Cards/2019/plate2019.jpg">
three awesome plays at the plate </a>.  #310 Javier Baez, #440 Dustin Pedroia, and #428 Pablo Sandoval give us <a href="Cards/2019/tag2019.jpg">
three nifty tag plays</a> on the base paths.<br />
Uniquely:
<ul>
  <li>Enrique Hernandez #117 making a <a href="Cards/2019/hernandez.jpg">nice sliding catch</a></li>
  <li>Adam Engel #196 <a href="Cards/2019/engel.jpg">taking away a home run</a></li>
  <li>Adam Cimber #550 <a href="Cards/2019/cimber.jpg">twisting like a pretzel</a></li>
  <li>Francisco Lindor #269 doing his best <a href="Cards/2019/lindor.jpg">Michael Jordan shrug</a></li>
  <li>Yoan Moncada #377 <a href="Cards/2019/moncada.jpg">sheding his helmet for effect?</a></li>
</ul>
In Shohei Ohtani's checklist card #367 and the Mets team card #497 we get <a href="Cards/2019/art2019.jpg">two very artsy shots.</a>
<a href="Cards/2019/barnes.jpg">Austin Barnes #456</a> reminds me of <a href="Cards/2018/cool18-H.jpg">Caleb Joseph in 2018</a>.
And <a href="Cards/2019/garverplus.jpg">Mitch Garver #277</a> reminds me once again of Willie Horton in his 1969 WS card.  This also 
gives you a quick look at how far our photography has come in 50 years!<br />
Finally, it takes a couple hall-of-famers from 1964 to make the 1984 set look nice!  Ernie Banks #T84-16 and Willie McCovey # T84-76
were two in a big set of <a href="Cards/2019/HOF.jpg">1984-style reprints</a>.  Just a note, these two combined for 1033 home runs :)
