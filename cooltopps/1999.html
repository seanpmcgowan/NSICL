<p>Just a great baseball picture, and a classic lefty swing.
<a href="Cards/1999A.JPG">#265 Nomar</a> is also kind of cool.  I remember
really liking both these cards as soon as I saw them.  In 1999 Topps commemerated
the long career of <a href="Cards/1999R.JPG">Nolan Ryan (#34 of course)</a>.  I'm not exactly sure why, but it
was probably because he was inducted into the Hall of Fame at Cooperstown that year.</p>
