<H2>How to use this site:</H2>
<p>There are three ways to enjoy this site, based mostly on how much time you want to spend
on it.  I have tried to set it up so that you can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buzz through real quick</li>
<li>Read the extra stuff, but not look at any other cards</li>
<li>Check out each and every one of the 499 cards I scanned for this site</li>
</ol>
<p>So, you can click on 1951, put the mouse over the "next page" link and just fire through
all 69 years, or you can take your time and read and look at other cards.  Just remember
to enjoy the cards.  They are, after all, very cool!</p>
