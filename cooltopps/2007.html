<h3>#40 Derek Jeter</h3>
</center>
<p>I really had no choice with this one.  When I saw it on the TV, before I ever
opened a pack, I noticed Mantle in the dugout right away, but not Bush!  Then I sold
the two that I pulled for a total of $90.  Three weeks later I bought 3 of them 
for a total of $30.  It pays to understand "the market".  Were it not for the antics
of the boys at topps <a href="Cards/2007A.jpg">#98 Marcus Giles</a> would have been
my choice.  A couple close 2nds whould be the requisite robbery depicted on
<a href="Cards/2007G.jpg">#580 Garret Anderson</a> and the nasty collision on 
<a href="Cards/2007F.jpg">#222 Scott Hatteberg</a>.  While the Jeter card was grabbing
all the headlines, no one noticed <a href="Cards/2007BC.jpg">#576 Betancourt and #588 Guillen</a>.
The Back of the Guillen is correct.  I have to wonder how Jose's auto got there. From the topps dance studio we have the
duo of <a href="Cards/2007DE.jpg">#103 Feliz and #111 Lopez</a>.  And
 <a href="Cards/2007H.jpg">#76 Lastings Milledge</a> gives us a clue to what he should be 
working on with his mechanics.  Finally <a href="Cards/2007I.jpg">#485 Tad Iguchi</a> reminded
me of '71 <a href="Cards/1971S.JPG">#445 Art Shamsky</a>, really.
