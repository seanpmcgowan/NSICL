<p>So far, Joe was an 8-year bench warmer with a .257 average, but he strikes
a mean pose here.  Must be a lefty thing.  All in all, this is a pretty dull looking set.  Check out
<a href="Cards/1981H.JPG">#414 John Pacella</a> and his hat!  And some guys
are just too tired to get off the bench on picture day...what do you suppose
<a href="Cards/1981B.JPG">#624 Welch and #651 Guerrero</a> are looking at?
