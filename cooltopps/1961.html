<p>Again in '61 my real favorite card is not a regular player card.  <a href="Cards/1961WS.JPG">#312</a>
is the World Series card for game 7 of the '60 series when Mazeroski beat
the Yankees with a walk-off home run.  The back of the card recaps the scoring
for the whole game.  A <a href="Cards/1961WSback.JPG">must read</a>!<br>
The '61 set is probably 50% head shots and 50% poses.  This one is just a 
classic picture of the Mick.  It was close between this one, the <a href="Cards/1961A.JPG">#10 Brooks and
the #296 Covington</a>, where Wes is pulling a bat from the rack.  This pose is 
repeated by many players through the years, and it always looks cool.
