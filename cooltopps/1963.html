<p>Don looks in charge here.  Again, this is a card I owned from my youth, even
though I didn't start buying cards until 1969.  Always one of my favorites.  Maybe
partly because I knew that my Orioles had bested Drysdale, and Koufax! :)
And, remember "Marvelous Marv"?  Well he was still around for the <a href="Cards/1963A.JPG">'63 set, #78</a> and you 
see the little picture in the circle...yup, you guessed it...that same photo with
a yellow background, and now a Mets emblem on tha hat and still no letters on the
shirt
