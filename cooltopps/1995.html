<p>Alex does his best <a href="Cards/1956.JPG">Rocky Bridges</a> here, and it is pretty good.
Excelent height and extention.  I hope he nailed the landing!  The back of the card says that
Alex is an "exciting baserunner".  Ya think?  In 1995 topps commemerated the 100th Birthday of
The Babe with <a href="Cards/1995R.JPG">card #3</a> (get it). They also did some tricky photo
stuff for the 2nd year in a row with <a href="Cards/1995P.JPG">#110 Walt Weiss and #67 Royce Clayton</a>.
There were other cards with this trick stuff, but the funny thing about these two is that Clayton
is on both!  Topps also tried some tacky stuff such as <a href="Cards/1995O.JPG">#426 Paul O'Neill</a>.
and some stuff that was a little scary <a href="Cards/1995S.JPG">(#522 Sandy Alomar)</a>.
