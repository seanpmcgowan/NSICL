<p>Yes, I dislike Gary Carter as much as anyone, but there is something about a play at
the plate, and this is a great shot of a great catcher.  There is also a nifty <a href="Cards/1980R.JPG">#580
Ryan</a> card, and it is nice to know that some things never change... <a href="Cards/1980H.JPG">#482 Henderson</a> is Ricky's
rookie card, and you can see that his stance is the same after 24 years.  Go Ricky.
