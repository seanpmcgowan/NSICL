<p>The '53's are all head shots until the last series where there are maybe a dozen or
so "action" poses (most notably <a href="Cards/1953M.JPG">#244 Mays</a> - mine is trimmed).  What makes this set special is the nifty
artwork, including the backgrounds.  This one is my favorite because it depicts a night
game in the background!  Pretty cool.  Dark sky and all.  And, if you read the back (as
you always should) the writers call Dick "one of the brightest young prospects".  Coincidence?
I think not!</p>
