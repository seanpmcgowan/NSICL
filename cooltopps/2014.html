<p>There were lots of the usual stuff with no real standouts.  So,  I picked
one of my favs!  This is also appropriate because the Orioles are currently
6 games ahead in the AL East!  There were lots of quality shots, including
more than one of each of the following...<br />
dugout shots such as <a href="Cards/2014/2014dugout.jpg">#224 Mike Saunders</a>;
home plate celebrations such as <a href="Cards/2014/2014celebrate.jpg">#637 Freddy Glavis</a>;
strking the pose such as <a href="Cards/2014/2014pose.jpg">#97 Alex Gordon</a>;
throwback unis such as <a href="Cards/2014/2014throwback.jpg">#183 Darwin Barney</a>;
running catches such as <a href="Cards/2014/2014running.jpg">#212 Jason Heyward</a>;
caught stealing such as <a href="Cards/2014/2014caught.jpg">#559 Asdrubal Cabrera</a>;
robbing a home run such as <a href="Cards/2014/2014robbery.jpg">#357 Lorenzo Cain</a>;
diving catches such as <a href="Cards/2014/2014diving.jpg">#59 Nate Schierholtz</a>;
throwing catchers such as <a href="Cards/2014/2014catcher.jpg">#287 Miguel Montero</a>;
straining pitchers such as <a href="Cards/2014/2014pitching.jpg">#543 Bud Norris</a>;
infield flips such as <a href="Cards/2014/2014flip.jpg">#133 Xander Bogaerts</a>;
turning 2 such as <a href="Cards/2014/2014dp.jpg">#172 Rickie Weeks</a>;
signing autos such as <a href="Cards/2014/2014signing.jpg">#194 Joel Hanrahan</a>;
getting doused such as <a href="Cards/2014/2014dousing.jpg">#221 Brian Dozier</a>;
plays at the plate such as <a href="Cards/2014/2014plate.jpg">#225 Brian McCann</a>;
yelling such as <a href="Cards/2014/2014yell.jpg">#367 Brian Wilson</a> (I didn't do that on purpose! all
those "Brian"'s just happened to be together!);
classic power swings such as <a href="Cards/2014/2014stroke.jpg">#475 David Ortiz</a>;
big slides at home such as <a href="Cards/2014/2014slide.jpg">#1 Mike Trout</a>;
</p>
<p>There were some funny unique shots such as...<br>
<a href="Cards/2014/2014hair.jpg">#8 Coco Crisp</a> with big hair, <a href="Cards/2014/2014eyes.jpg">#412 Hunter Pence</a> with big eyes, 
<a href="Cards/2014/2014football.jpg">#273 Mark Derosa</a> catching
the wrong ball, and clever product placement on <a href="Cards/2014/2014brand.jpg">#619 Chris Johnson</a>.
</p>
<p>If it were a "regular" card, <a href="Cards/2014/2014mariano.jpg">#321 Mariano Rivera</a> "Yankees Legend Retires", likely would have been
the pick.  This is a great shot of Jeter and Petit on the mound "getting" Mariano in his
last game.
</p>
<p>Finally, Topps inserted actual old cards into some packs.  I got 8 of them...6 from
the '70's, 1 from the '60's and this 1959 <a href="Cards/2014/2014-1959.jpg">#36 Hank aguirre</a>.  Kind of fun pulling a card 
from my birth year from a pack.</p>
