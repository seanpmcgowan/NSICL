<p> This is actually kind of a bland year.  And I want to assure you that the fact that Austin is wearing an Orioles uniform had nothing to do with my choice...
This is just a great shot of a guy playin' ball, and doing it right.
A close runner up was <a href="Cards/2021/dansbySwanson233.jpg">#233 Dansby Swanson</a>.  This reminded me a myself when I was 16 in the championship game!
I don't know what happened here, but in my instance, the catcher missed the ball and there was no play.  We still lost though :(
Also for your entertainment, we have:
<ul>
  <li> some sillyness with <a href="Cards/2021/silly2021.jpg">Austin Riley #111 and Didi Gregorius #561</a>.  The feet on the Riley card are my favorite!</li>
  <li> a couple nice bunting shots <a href="Cards/2021/bunting2021.jpg">Gregory Polanco #412 and Eddie Rosario #356</a> both are good but I like Rosario's with the ball on the lower half of the bat!</li>
  <li> <a href="Cards/2021/Dubon-Oh.jpg">Mauricio Dubon #8</a> doing his best Sadaharu Oh.</li>
  <li> <a href="Cards/2021/Soto-Kirilloff-Horton.jpg">Juan Soto #330 and Alex Kirilloff #413</a> harken back to one of my fav WS cards from the '69 set.</li>
  <li> diving for a catch is "future star" <a href="Cards/2021/trentGrisham249.jpg">Trent Grisham #249</a></li>
  <li> sliding head first into third very seriously is <a href="Cards/2021/joshHarrison290.jpg">Josh Harrison #290</a></li>
  <li> and finally we have at least the 4th player in a classic pose that started with <a href="Cards/1956.jpg">Rocky Bridges in 1956</a>...<a href="Cards/2021/ronaldAcuna263.jpg">Ronald Acuna #263</a></li>
</ul>
