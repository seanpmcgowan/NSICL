<p>The 1957 cards were the first topps set that are the same size as todays
"standard" cards.  They also use nothing but actual photos.  Still no real
action photos, that is still several years off, but some very nice poses.  "Klu"'s
pose is far-and-away the best!  At 6-foot-2 and 220, he cut an awesome figure.
He also cut off his sleeves!  Gabe Kapler should mimic this pose on his '04 card.
