<h3 class="first">How NSICL matches are to be scored</center></h3>

<p class="hang">Each school must field a minimum of 5 players in order of ability level on boards 1-5.  If a school has less
than 5 players, any empty boards (1-5) will be a forfeit, and the points will go to the other school.
If both schools are able to accommodate additional players (usually arranged 
prior to the day of the match), these games will also count toward the match result. 
Each board is worth the following number of points:</p><br>
<table>
<tr>
    <td width=5%></td>
    <td width="25%" class="txtclr">
    Board 1 ---> 10pts<br>
    Board 2 --->  9pts<br>
    Board 3 --->  8pts<br>
    Board 4 --->  7pts<br>
    Board 5 --->  6pts<br>
    </td>
    <td width=5%></td>  
    <td class="txtclr">
    A win earns all of the available points for the board.  A draw earns half of the available
    points for the board.  A loss earns zero points.
    </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="hang">If additional boards can be accommodated by both schools, 
the board points will be:</p>

<table>
<tr>
    <td width=5%></td>
    <td width="25%" class="txtclr">
    Board 6 ---> 3pts<br>
    Board 7 ---> 2pts<br>
    Board 8 ---> 1pts<br>
    Board 9 ---> 1pts<br>
    Board 10 ---> 1pts<br>
    etc., etc. 
    </td>
    <td width=5%></td>
    <td class="txtclr">
    Any boards beyond board #8 will be worth 1 point.
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3 class="first">Who Wins?  Who goes to the Playoffs?</center></h3>

<p class="hang">The winner of a match is the school that earns the most board points in a given match.
If both schools earn the same number of board points, then the match is scored a draw.  
For the purpose of league standings, the most important result is the team's match record.
Head-to-Head matches will be the primary tie-break for determining playoff teams.  If the tied teams did not
play, or split their match(es) then the total number of board points earned for the entire season will be
the tie breaker.  If the teams are still tied in the standings, the total W/L/D record for the first 5 boards
will be the tie-breaker.  If these records are the same, then only boards 1-4 will be considerd, etc.  If 
all these records are the same, the league president will do a coin flip (sorry) to decide the team that
advances to the playoffs, or gets the higher seed.
<br />  <br />
The top four teams will advance to the playoffs.  For the first round, 1st place will host 4th place and 2nd place will host 3rd place
<br />  <br />
The championship will be hosted by the winner from the first round with the highest seed.
<br />  <br />
If two teams tie in a playoff match, the score for the first 5 boards will determine which
team advances.  If the score for boards 1-5 is the same, then only boards 1-4 will be 
considerd, etc.  If boards 1-5 are all draws then the highest board that is not a draw
will determine the winner.  If all boards are draws then the host coach will chose a
pawn from the visiting coach.  If the host coach choses the white pawn then the host team
will advance, otherwise the visiting team will advance.

<h3 class="first"><center>Official NSICL League Rules</center></h3>

<p class="hang">1.)  Official correspondence will be maintained by faculty advisors only.  
Both teams have the responsibility for reporting results.  The results must be sent to 
the statistician as soon as possible.  Let's not be lazy on this one!!!  All league results, 
which include the match score and individual scores with board numbers and student names, 
shall be emailed to the designated league statistician.
</p>
<p class="hang">2.)  Match postponement or change must be arranged by the faculty advisors of both schools 
involved in said match.  
The statistician must be informed of the changed and make-up date so as to not incur 
any penalties.  Under no circumstances must a match be postponed simply because a school 
does not have enough players.  All matches must be played with or without "key players."  
This type of postponement will be counted as a forfeit.</p>
<p class="hang">3.)  Forfeited matches will count as a 40-0 win.  Individual player points will be given to the 
top five boards.</p>
<p class="hang">4.)  Shuffling of positions by a team <b><i>to gain an advantage</i></b> is not allowed. Players should 
be ranked by the advisor, according to player ability from #1-5.  
When a higher board is missing, two options are available:
<br>a) The board is forfeited, and other players remain at their scheduled boards.
<br>b) The board is played by a player other than boards 1 - 5.</p>
<p class="hang">5.)  The home team should be ready when the visiting team arrives.  Clocks of missing  
players will be started as soon as the other players are at the boards and ready to play.  
If the visiting team fails to arrive by 3:45, and notification of late arrival 
has not been made, the match will count as a forfeit.</p>
<p class="hang">6.)  During the match, at least one advisor must be accessible to the players.</p>
<p class="hang">7.)  The home team will play white on the odd numbered boards and black on the even 
numbered boards.</p>
<p class="hang">8.)  All games will be played with Staunton-type chess sets, if available.  
The two players must agree if another type of set is to be used.  If a team does not 
have enough of the Staunton-type sets, the advisor should ask the visiting advisor 
to bring additional sets.</p>

<h3 class="first"><center>Official NSICL Individual Match Rules</center></h3>
<p class="hang">1.)  All matches are Game-45.  If there are not enough clocks, the available clocks
will be used at the highest boards first (starting with board 1)</p>
<p class="hang">2.)  All moves are "touch" moves.  If the player touches the piece
 and there is a legal move for that piece, that piece must be moved.  The move is complete
when the player releases the piece.  It is not proper etiquette to ask your opponent if you
can "take back" a move.</p>
<p> If a player's time expires, it is the responsibility of that players opponent to note that, and 
to declare a win.  If a teammate of the player (with time remaining on the clock) calls attention
to the fact that time has expired on his opponents clock, the match will be declared a draw. </p>
<p class="hang">3.)  There should be no talking other than to say "adjust", "check" or 
"checkmate".  The only exception is if a player wants to ask the team captain if
the player should accept a draw, or offer a draw.  The captain is allowed to answer this
question based on the current match score, not based on the players current status
in the individual match.</p>
