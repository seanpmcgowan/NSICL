<p>This is perhaps the coolest card Topps ever produced.  Not bad for the very
first real action shot on a card.  There were actual action shots in the 1st,3rd,
 and 4th series in 1971.  I never realized before that the action shots were not
in every series.  Other than the Munson, I always liked <a href="Cards/1971S.JPG">#445 Art Shamsky</a>, and there
is the classic double play on <a href="Cards/1971R.JPG">#118 Cookie Rojas</a>.  There are a bunch of nice shots, and
it only took Topps 20 years!  The '71's also contain the first of several "floating head"
team cards of the <a href="Cards/1971C.JPG">Cubs (#502)</a>.  Why just the Cubs?  Perhaps the most interesting card
in the set is <a href="Cards/1971H.JPG">#355 Bud Harrelson</a>.  See it yet?  Check the forground...yup, that is Nolan
Ryan making the "out" call.
