<p>This card is probably my favorite over all.  This is my favorite set, and the first
year I bought cards, and one of my favorite players on my favorite team, and just a really
cool looking card.  My second favorite card has to be the <a href="Cards/1969EW.JPG">#516 Weaver</a> card.  Really cool
black background, and very young looking Earl!  The card I show off the most in my collection
is the <a href="Cards/1969WL.JPG">#500 Mantle</a> with the white letters!  Pulled that one from a pack myself!  When I think
of World Series cards, I think of the '69 cards of the 1968 Series.  The <a href="Cards/1969WS.JPG">game 6 #167</a> is my
favorite, but they are all really neat.  The way a world series card should be. There was also
a cool insert set in the 3rd series.  They are called "deckel edged" and of the 33 cards, the
<a href="Cards/1969D.JPG">#33 Mays</a> was always my favorite.  Because this is my favorite set, I wanted to show you all the
other cool cards!  <a href="Cards/1969B.JPG">#20-Banks,#50-Clemente,#150-McLain,#190-Mays,#630-Bonds and #640-Jenkins</a>.  Also
<a href="Cards/1969A.JPG">#95-Bench,#120-Rose,#130-Yaz,#400-Drysdale,#650-Williams</a>.  Of course amoung my favorites for the
set were many Oriole cards! <a href="Cards/1969O.JPG">#15-Boog,#340-McNally,#506-Blair,#550-Brooks,#573-Palmer</a>.  And finally,
in the 1968 set, Larry Haney was an Oriole... in the '69 set he was a Pilot.  Not only did the
Pilots apparently steal some Oriole-colored catchers equipment, but, well you take a look at
<a href="Cards/1969M.JPG">'68 #42 Haney and his '69 #209 evil twin</a>. I hope you
have enjoyed my favorite set as much as I have!
