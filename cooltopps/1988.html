For whatever reason, there weren't many nifty shots here.  I went with 
Griffey working his lead off 2nd base. A nice baseball picture. The '88 set
contained "team leaders" cards.  Two nifty ones are <a href="Cards/1988TL.JPG">#51 Orioles (Murray/Ripken) and 
#759 Athletics (McGwire/Canseco).</a> Two pretty cool cards. I don't know about you, but
when I watched the Red Sox in 1988, I thought they had it going.  Check out <a href="Cards/1988RS.JPG">#269 Burks
and #493 Greenwell</a>.  What happened?  Finally, we have an obvious vintage card collector and
Mickey Mantle fan...<a href="Cards/1988A.JPG">Mike Hart - #69</a> surely planned this!
