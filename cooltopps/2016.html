<h1>2016 Topps</h1>
<h3>#609 Billy Hamilton</h3>
</center>
<p>Great ups, full extension, reaching back, and a snow-cone!</p>
<p>This was a tough call, because there were tons of great shots, but none that really stood out.</p>
<p>We had <a href="Cards/2016/cool16-06.jpg">Jason Kipnis #195, Yasiel Puig #139 and Josh Reddick
#472</a> with other fielding gems.<br />
<a href="Cards/2016/cool16-05.jpg">Nate Jones #679, Ichiro #700, and Manny Machado #175</a> just looking menacing.<br />
<a href="Cards/2016/cool16-02.jpg">Derek Norris #677, and Melvin Upton Jr. #124</a> with plays at the plate.<br />
<a href="Cards/2016/cool16-01.jpg">Adam Jones #210,  and Gregory Polanco #428</a> hitting.</p>
<p>There were also many "water bucket" pictures, the "best" of which is 
<a href="Cards/2016/cool16-04.jpg"> Shawn Tolleson #688 </a> who you can barley make out in the picture.  Shouldn't this be Odor's card?  Finally 
to carry on a theme from last year, <a href="Cards/2016/cool16-03.jpg"> Pablo Sandoval #285 </a> is listed at 5'11" and 255lbs.  I'm not sure
I believe it!</p>
