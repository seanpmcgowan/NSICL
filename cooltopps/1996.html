<p>This set really has a bunch of great shots.  From here on in, I think the photo work
gets really good.  This is a great shot of Jose sneaking his hand in under the catcher's foot.  Makes
you expect to see #42 on the shirt. Topps had 2 commemerative cards in '96 <a href="Cards/1996C.JPG">#7 Mantle and #96 Ripken</a>.
Ripken's was obviously for breaking Gehrig's streak, and Mantle's was because he
died.  This was the real beginning of the vintage reprints for Topps.  They reprinted
all Mantle's cards (Topps and Bowman) and randomly inserted them in packs.</p>
