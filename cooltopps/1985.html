<p>In 1985 Topps had a bunch of special cards... record breakers, all-stars,
father-and-son cards... but, the standard cards just didn't have much for
cool cards.  They looked sort of flat.  This one is a throw-back.  Doesn't
it remind you of the <a href="Cards/1961.JPG">'61 Mantle</a>?  A classic shot of a great player.
