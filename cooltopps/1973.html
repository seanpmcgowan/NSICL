<p>The "action" cards were back in the 1973 set.  Plenty of them.  This time there were
more close-up action shots, some without lots of actual action, but the players were in
a game and moving.  Over all, I think the '71 "action" shots were still the best.  Either
the photographer couldn't wait for Kaat to get to the mound, or, he didn't like the
shots of Jim pitching, or, it was an accident.  Actually, it was probably Kaat's idea.
