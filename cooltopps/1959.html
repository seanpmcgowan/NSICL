<h1>1959 Topps</h1>
<h3>#155 Enos Slaughter</h3>
</center>
<p>In 1959 topps combined the colored backgrounds with the actual photos to 
produce perhaps the ugliest set of all.  My birthyear, of course.  My favorite
card is <a href="Cards/1959M.JPG">#464 "Babeball Thrills"</a> which is a 3 picture sequence of Willie Mays'
famous catch on Vic Wertz in the '54 series.  But, because I am sticking to 
"regular", single-player cards here, I will pick the first '59 I owned.  
I forget where I got it, but I eventually
learned that it was "Country" Slaughter who scored the World Series winning run
for the Cardinals on Boston's Johnny Pesky's hesitation throw in game 7 in 1946.
