<h1>2018 Topps</h1>
<h3>#68 Billy Hamilton</h3>

<p>Billy is doing his best David Letterman impersonation (look up his velcro suit trick).  The colors are just great too!  This years honorable mentions include
#556 Andrew Benintendi and #265 Javier Baez in <a href="Cards/2018/cool18-V.jpg"> verticle shots </a> and #597 Caleb Joseph and #550 Corey Seager in <a href="Cards/2018/cool18-H.jpg">
great horizontal shots </a>.  Nice stuff!  There were also four really nifty diving catch shots.   Check out <a href="Cards/2018/cool18-diving.jpg">#61 Keon Broxton, #91 Travis D'Arnaud,
 #481 Ronald Torreyes, and, #518 Andrew Toles. </a>
There were two cards that jarred my memory.  First <a href="Cards/2018/cool18-HR.jpg"> #148 Richard Urena </a> remined me of <a href="Cards/2018/cool18-WSHR.jpg"> 2001 #386 Joe Carter </a>.
Actually, I wasn't reminded of the 2001 card, as much as I was reminded of the 1993 WS winning HR.  If you ever want to hear the story, I called that home run.  For real.  Then there was
 <a href="Cards/2018/cool18-stanton.jpg"> #100 Giancarlo Stanton </a>.  I knew it reminded me of something,
so I searched and found <a href="Cards/2018/cool18-stanton-smith.jpg"> 1957 #145 Al Smith </a>.  But, inspite of the obvious similarities, I still thought I was thinking of a different
card.  Then I remembered.  Take a look at Giancarlo with one of my favorite MLB players ever,
<a href="Cards/2018/cool18-stanton-flood.jpg"> 1967 #245 Curt Flood </a>!  As a matter of fact, here are <a href="Cards/2018/cool18-flood.jpg">Flood's cards from '62, and '65-'69 </a>! 
 And none of these are repeat pictures!  If you don't know about Curt Flood and free agency, look it up, and then know that no active major leaguers came to his funeral.
