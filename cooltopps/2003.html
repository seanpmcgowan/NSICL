<p>Surprisingly, there aren't many cool shots in this set.  Perhaps the
fact that this is Ichiro tipped my hand a little, but I try to go with the
cards that make me say "cool", and who the player is is part of what makes
me say that. There was a funny picture, <a href="Cards/2003P.JPG">#234 Matt Lawton</a>
apparently having a tough time with the sun on this pop-up.  Also in one of the
substsets, <a href="Cards/2003G.JPG">#702 Edmonds</a> is a really cool shot,
but not a "regular" card.  As I was going through the set, I thought I had found
the same card in the wrong spot when I got to <a href="Cards/2003D.JPG">#493 Craig Wilson
after seeing #391 Bubba Trammell</a>.  Funny huh?</p>
