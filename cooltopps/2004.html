<p>Unlike last year, this set is loaded with great action shots.  But when my current
favorite player is taking away a home run, it isn't a tough choice. As an example of
some of the other great shots <a href="Cards/2004D.JPG">#204 Jack Wilson</a> is caught
from a different angle turning a double play.  Lots of cool shots on the basepaths,
so I figured we could go around the horn with <a href="Cards/2004HORN.JPG">#118 Jason 
Phillips (1B), #548 Brady Clark (2B), #411 Jason Bay (3B), and #490 Roger Cedeno (Home)
</a>.And we have 3 "flashblacks"... Remember from '03 <a href="Cards/2003D.JPG">#493 Craig
 Wilson and #391 Bubba Trammell</a>?  Well check <a href="Cards/2004C.JPG">#153 Jason Kendal</a>.
  Also, remember Rocky Bridges from 1956?  <a href="Cards/1995.JPG">Alex Diaz</a> was an imitator
 in '95 but this year we have a near perfect match in <a href="Cards/2004A.JPG">#594 Morgan Ensberg</a>.
The 1969 cards depicting the 1968 World Series are my favorite, and you can
see why <a href="Cards/2004B.JPG">#217 Preston Wilson</a> reminded me of the card for game 2.
Finally, I think it is clear from card <a href="Cards/2004glove.JPG">#181 that Jason Michaels</a> has the situation well in hand!</p>
